Including Medela. With my other child I encountered breastfeeding problems and had a horrible cheap pump. Now with my new baby she was born with a heart problem (she is fine now after a long road to recovery) and had to stay in the hospital for an extended length of time. Meanwhile I had other children at home and we live 6 hours away from our family and so I had no choice but to divide my time between the hospital and home, which meant I needed a hospital grade pump originally I rented one from the hospital (Medela) and it made my breasts hurt really bad. On the way home from the hospital I stopped in at Babiesrus and bought this pump because it was on our registry (we studied and found it to be more comfortable and with coupons it was much cheaper than Medela,) and started using it and I have been so happy with it that sometimes I still use it so my husband can give her a bottle! I love that all I have to do is pump it and add a nipple and its ready to go and its also easier to store than regular breastmilk bags from medela and its also less expensive also. I love the quiet operation I can pump while were watching tv and we don't have to turn the tv up!\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Has more comforts than Medela!', 'unixReviewTime': 1116547200, 'reviewTime': '05 20, 2005', 'hash': -5873851704565409476}\n"
